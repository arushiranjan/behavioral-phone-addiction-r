# behavioral-phone-addiction-r
This project analyzes smartphone usage patterns to identify behavioral trends and predict potential addiction levels. Using machine learning models in R, the system processes usage data (app duration, frequency, screen time) and classifies users based on risk. The aim is to support early awareness and promote healthier digital habits.

### Key Steps 
 - Data cleaning, transformation, and visualization (EDA) 
 - Proxy target creation using weighted z-score composite index 
 - Train-test split and model training using: - Logistic Regression - Random Forest - XGBoost - Attention-Inspired Weighted Ensemble Model 
 - Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC - Real-time prediction app developed as part of the team 
 
 ### Results 
 - Ensemble model achieved the highest classification performance, particularly improving recall for high-addiction cases. 
 - Screen time, social media usage, and gaming time emerged as the top predictors.
